The Hacky Hour is an informal meetup at our local BU Pub for anyone interested in coding. Newcomers are particularly welcome -- no experience required! Come to chat with us about programming and science, to get help with a particularly tricky bug, or just to meet some fellow researchers. Look for a table with a lot of laptops and some [Science Foxes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbVhvY2WEAAAMeV.png).
